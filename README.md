# AutoMinecart
A useful Minecraft plugin that spawns a Minecart upon right-clicking a rail and teleports the player into the cart. It saves players having to get a minecart, place it, then enter it.

The plugin was made with the [Paper 1.18 API](https://papermc.io/), and is compatible with Spigot servers from 1.18 onwards.

**Features**
- Allows players to right-click on a plain rail and get teleported into an automatically-spawned minecart
- Add/remove disabled worlds in the `config.yml` file
- Use the permission `"autominecart.use"` to allow non-OP players to use the plugin
- Use the `/togglecart` command to toggle the functionality on or off for yourself

**Instalation**
1. Go to the [Spigot Page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/autominecart.101327/)
2. Download the .jar file on the top right
3. Add the .jar file to your server's `plugins` folder
4. Reload/Restart your server
5. Enjoy!
